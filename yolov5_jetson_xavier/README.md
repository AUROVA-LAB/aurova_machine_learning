To create this Dockerfile, I use the l4t-ml docker image that contains Tensorflow, PyTorch and other popular ML and data science frameworks.

This image is available for several JetPacks. All the information about JetPack version and package version is in the following link: https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-ml
